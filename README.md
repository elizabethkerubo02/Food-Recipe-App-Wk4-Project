You can also select a search category from the drop-down menu next to the search bar, such as "Category" or "Area". Click the "Search" button to display a list of recipes that match your search query.

This will open a modal window with more information about the recipe, including the recipe name, category, ingredients, and instructions. You can also watch a video of how to prepare the recipe by clicking the "Watch Video" link.

To view your liked dishes, click on the "Liked Dishes" button. This will display a list of all the recipes that you have saved as "Liked" by clicking the heart icon on the recipe details page.

To view a random dish, click on the "Random Dish" button. This will display a randomly selected recipe from the database.
